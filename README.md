# coliru
A minimal, flexible, dotfile installer

## Installation
To install `coliru`, clone the repository and run `cargo install --path coliru/`

To uninstall `coliru`, run `cargo uninstall coliru`

## Usage
Dotfiles are defined as a series of steps inside a manifest file that are
    executed conditionally based on tag rules.
To install dotfiles, pass the manifest file and tag rules to `coliru`:

```
coliru path/to/manifest.yml --tag-rules tag1 tag2,tag3 ^tag4
```

Some helpful options include:

- `--help`, `-h`: Print full help information
- `--dry-run`, `-n`: Do a trial run without any permanent changes
- `--copy`, `-c`: Interpret link commands as copy commands

## Manifest File
Manifests are defined using YAML.
Each manifest contains a series of steps that are executed to install the
    dotfiles.
Each step contains an array of tags and any number of copy, link, or run
    commands.
The copy command copies a file from a source (`src`) to a (`dst`).
The link command links a file from a source (`src`) to a (`dst`) using symbolic
    links on Unix platforms and hard links on Windows.
Finally, the run command executes a script (`src`) from the command line, using
    `sh` on Unix platforms and `powershell` on Windows, with an optional
    `prefix` (e.g. `python3`) or `postfix` (e.g. `arg1 arg2 arg3`) string.

Example YAML manifest:

```yml
steps:
  - copy:
    - src: git_dotfiles/.gitconfig
      dst: ~/.gitconfig
    link:
    - src: vim_dotfiles/.vimrc
      dst: ~/.vimrc
    tags: [ windows, linux, macos ]
  - run:
    - src: install_programs.sh
      prefix: bash # Unecessary if install_programs.sh is executable
      postfix: -y
    tags: [ linux ]
```

## Tag Rules
Tag rules are specified on the command line using the `--tag-rules` option.
In order for a manifest step to be executed, its tags must satisfy all of the
    tag rules.
If no tags rules are provided, all manifest steps will be executed.
Each tag rule contains a comma separated list of tags that will satisfy the
    rule.
A leading caret (`^`) will negate the entire rule.
In other words, commas correspond to OR, carets to NOT, and the spaces between
    rules to AND.
So the tag rules `A B,C ^D,E` are equivalent to `A && (B || C) && !(D || E)`.
